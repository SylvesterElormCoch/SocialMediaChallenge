# SocialMediaChallenge
## Sylvester Elorm Coch

This project was built as part of one of the DALI lab developer challenges. You can find the developer challenge [here](https://github.com/dali-lab/dali-challenges/blob/master/docs/SocialMediaChallenge.md)

### How to build the project
You can run `npm start` from the terminal to build and run the project on your local server.

### Basic Idea
With data about members of teh dali lab, I made a simple social media UI page with a drawer navigation. One can click on the profile snippet on the `Explore` screen to view the `user profile` in detail and navigate back through the side menu.

### What went well
I enjoyed using react and thinking about how to structure different UI components and state information. I also got to try on some interesting UI and CSS animations.

### Challenges
With more time, I could have fully navigable links on the drawer navigation. For now, only the `Explore` link actually gets you somewehere. Also, I could improve the detailed profile UI a bit more. I could possibly explore using `redux` to manage state.
